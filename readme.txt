WSIM

This is the Fall 2012 final project of the ECE421 Analog Design class at Portland State University.
The team members are Nathan Upperman, Xi Li, and Chris Andrews.  The Goal is to simulate in schematic
and layout, different, improved versions of current mirrors, leading up to the wide swing current mirror.
We will be using electric-vlsi version 9.03 which is an open source free java based vlsi program.  The spice
simulation will be done on LTspiceIV which is available for free from linear technologies.
The versions are:

1.  Simple current mirror
2.  Source Degenerated current mirror
3.  Cascode current mirror
4.  wide swing current mirror
5.  improved wide swing current mirror

By the way, WSIM stands for Wide Swing (current = I) Mirror.
